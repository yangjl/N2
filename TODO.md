# May 16th, 2017
1. More data
2. re-do HAPMIX


# Jan 14th, 2015
1. re-do from the beginning, because HAPMIX need only subset of the parental SNPs
1. format fastPHASE output to HAPMIX
2. run HAPMIX

# June 30th, 2015
1. PCA
2. run HapMix (sorting based on N2-fixation)
3. Run HapMix for the parviglumis
3. Fst

----------------
In the further:
1. Three whole genome sequencing of Totontepec lines
2. 23 HapMap2 landraces with whole genome sequencing data
3. Some Highland and lowland Mexicane lines from Matt.
